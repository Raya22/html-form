## before you start designing your website there's things you have to know

* First : who is the site for ? "who your target audience is".
to know the individuals and the companies for the audience.
* Why People Visit Your Website .
* What your visitors are trying to achieve
* What information your visitors need
* How often people will visit your site

## then you will start planing how to design the style of yor website
you can make a **Site Maps** so know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

then **WireFrames** which is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

and it is agood thing if you getting your message across using design you can use :
* visual hierarchy 
  * Size of the elements and fonts

## now you ready to start doing some programming
we will start designing the site using html which is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets, these are called HTML elements. to describe the structure of the page 
like if you want to design the header of the page

```html

<header>
    <p>paragraph in the page header</p>
    <img src=" " alt="">
    <nav>
        <ul>
                    <li>element</li>
                    <li>element</li>
                    <li>element</li>
                </ul>
    </nav>

</header>
``` 
so the header will contain a paragraph
```html
<p> </p>
``` and an image we used
```html
<img src=" " alt="">
```
and a navigations using 
```html
<nav> </nav>
```
and we used unorderd list `ul` to design the navigations
```html
<ul>
                    <li>element</li>
                    <li>element</li>
                    <li>element</li>
 </ul>
``` 

then you will design the body of the page which is contain much details so you can divide it as a `section`s using
```html
<body>
    <h1></h1>
    <h2></h2>
<section> </section>
<section> </section>
<section> </section>
</body>
```
`h1` for the main heading and `<h2>` for the sub heading
between the sections you can design paragraphs `<p>` , tables `<tr>` or lists `<ul>` 
and at the end of the page there is a `<footer>` which is typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

```html
<footer>
    <p> copyrights are reserved &copy;</p>
</footer>

```

 > ## CSS 
 Cascading Style Sheets which is mean the styles that added to html to solve problem or to design the page with much specific things saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
