                    What do I need to rent a car?  
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To book your car, all you need is a credit or debit card. When you pick the car up, you’ll need:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your voucher / eVoucher, to show that you’ve paid for the car.</li>
                        <li>The main driver’s credit / debit card, with enough available funds for the car’s deposit.</li>
                        <li>Each driver’s full, valid driving licence, which they’ve held for at least 12 months (often 24).</li>
                        <li>Your passport and any other ID the car rental company needs to see.</li>
                    </ul>    
                </p>

                        Renting a car is not always an easy task, especially during high seasons. 
                        Do you find yourself going to several car rental agencies only to find that they had ran out of available cars? 
                        Do you spend so much time trying to find the suitable vehicle that fits your needs as well as the money in your pocket? Save yourself all that trouble and find the car that you are looking for right here.
